This model is my interpretation of AQR's model within their paper, "Asset Allocation in a Higher-Rate World".
I am looking to make some changes to make the model my version. I believe that there shouldn't be this many "higher rate" regimes within the history of the dataset, which accounts for probably about 80% of the data.

Looking to add some statistics about the model as well, such as transitions, time spent in a regime, etc.
